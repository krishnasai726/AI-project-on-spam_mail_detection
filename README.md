# Spam Mail Detection (Machine Learning Project)

## 📌 Overview
A machine learning project to classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham** using **Logistic Regression**.  
Built in **Python (Google Colab)** with text preprocessing + TF-IDF vectorization.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Google Colab

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming)  
2. Feature extraction using TF-IDF  
3. Model training (Logistic Regression)  
4. Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)  

## 📊 Result
- Achieved **high accuracy** in detecting spam messages.  
- Balanced **precision & recall** to reduce false positives/negatives.
